​📄 SENTINEL PROTOCOL: THE UNIVERSAL DIGITAL VAULT & PRIVACY LAYER
​Technical White Paper v4.8
​1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
​Sentinel Protocol ($SNTL) is a decentralized infrastructure designed to secure and transfer digital existence. We solve the "Digital Extinction" problem by providing a permanent, privacy-centric, and biometric-secured bridge between current asset owners and their future heirs.
​2. THE HYPER-VAULT: MULTI-ASSET DEPOSITORY
​Sentinel is not a simple wallet; it is a Decentralized Safe Deposit Box for any digital value.
​Financial Tier: Secure storage for $BTC, $ETH, $SNTL, and all major blockchain assets.
​NFT & Digital Art: Full custody for NFTs, including secure metadata and provenance protection.
​Personal Legacy Tier: Military-grade encryption (AES-256) for:
​Digital Wills: Fully encrypted legal documents and vasiyetnames.
​Personal Media: Private photos, videos, and family archives.
​Credentials: Seed phrases, passwords, and private access keys.
​3. OPTIONAL PRIVACY: THE SHADOW LAYER
​Sentinel introduces the Shadow Protocol, allowing users to choose their level of transparency.
​Shadow Deposits: Utilizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and internal mixing to break the link between the sender's wallet and the vault.
​Shadow Withdrawals: Heirs can claim assets into new, untraceable addresses. The path from the original owner to the heir remains mathematically invisible.
​Ghost Mode: The vault remains hidden and encrypted on the blockchain. It does not exist to the public eye until the owner's pre-defined "Dead Man's Switch" is triggered.
​4. BIOMETRIC SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY
​Biometric Multi-Sig: Users can opt-in for Fingerprint or Face-ID authentication to lock/unlock high-value vaults via WebAuthn standards.
​Decentralized Sharding: Files are not stored in one place. They are broken into shards and distributed across a global decentralized network. Only the owner's key (or the heir's verified claim) can reassemble them.
​The Dead Man’s Switch: An automated inactivity monitor. If the owner fails to "check-in" within a set period, the protocol automatically initiates the encrypted transfer to the heir.
​5. TOKENOMICS ($SNTL)
​Utility: Payment for encrypted storage, privacy relay fees, and governance.
​Scarcity: A deflationary burn mechanism is applied to every vault creation and shadow transfer fee.
​6. VISION
​Sentinel Protocol aims to become the global standard for digital inheritance, ensuring that no digital asset is ever lost to the void of forgotten keys.
